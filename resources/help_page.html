    <h2>You have 6 tries to guess the word!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Each guess should be a real 5-letter word.</li>
        <li>Different colours are used to show how close your guess is to the actual word.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A random word to be guessed is generated every time the game is run (or when the user selects "Play Again" after
        they win or lose).</p>
    <p>The 'Points' section in the statistics window (click graph icon to open) represents how many tries it took to
        guess the correct word, out of the total number of possible tries. This statistic is like golf, in that a lower
        fraction means greater performance.</p>
